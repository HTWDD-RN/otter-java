On 2024/11/27 Michael Danzig changed the file pom.xml.
  Reason: 
    otter-java couldn't be built with the current version (0.2.0-SNAPSHOT) due to the following problems:
      1. The API was altered and the altered version was rejected by Revapi.
      2. Something about the versions of Revapi and SpotBugs didn't allow maven to build the whole project.
  Description of the changes:
    1. The version of SpotBugs was updated from 4.2.0 to 4.8.6.4
    2. The version of Revapi was updated from 0.13.2 to 0.15.0
    3. Revapi was notified of changes to several files in the block <revapi.differences>

On 2025/02/21 Michael Danzig changed the files
	1. otter-model/src/main/java/se/l4/otter/model/internal/SharedListImpl.java
	2. otter-model/src/main/java/se/l4/otter/model/internal/SharedStringImpl.java
	3. otter-model/src/test/java/se/l4/otter/model/SharedListTest.java
  Reason: 
    1. The change fixed a bug where the rest of the SharedListImpl was calculated wrongly in removeRange.
    2. The change fixed a bug where SharedStringImpl's insert method triggered insertions twice instead of once.
    3. The tests of the SharedList implementation needed to be made compatible with another project and it's own implementation for easier comparison.
  Description of the changes:
  	1. In otter-model/src/main/java/se/l4/otter/model/internal/SharedListImpl.java:
  	  The line 213 was changed from 
  		delta.retain(length - (toIndex - fromIndex));
  	  to 
  		delta.retain(length - index);
  	2. In otter-model/src/main/java/se/l4/otter/model/internal/SharedStringImpl.java:
  	  The lines 154 which read "this.value.insert(idx, value);" and the empty line 155 were removed.
  	  This fix was found on https://github.com/LevelFourAB/otter-java/commit/924f12e2083a0e089bc5d26cddc723ff13163cb9
  	3. 
  	  In otter-model/src/test/java/se/l4/otter/model/SharedListTest.java the tests testCustomSharedListRemoveRange and testCustomSharedListRemove
  	  and the static method assertSharedListEquals were added.

On 2025/03/06 Michael Danzig changed the file otter-engine/src/test/java/se/l4/otter/engine/DefaultEditorControlTest.java    
  Reason: 
    More tests for delete operations were needed in order to compare the DefaultEditorControl with a custom implemention of EditorControl in another project.  
  Description of the changes:
  	added the two tests testEditsFromSameHistoryIdWithMultipleDeletes and testEditsFromSameHistoryIdWithMultipleDeletesOfTheSamePart    
    
On 2025/03/13 Michael Danzig changed the file pom.xml.
  Reason: 
  	Another project which depends on otter-java and spring-boot had problems with differing slf4j versions.
  Description of the changes:
  	slf4j was updated from version 1.7.30 to 2.0.16. 

On 2025/04/04 Michael Danzig changed the file otter-model/src/main/java/se/l4/otter/model/DefaultModel.java    
  Reason: 
    The DefaultModel's method apply is only called by the SharedObjectEditorImpl when it receives a change caused by a SharedObject. 
    All those changes are triggered locally. Therefore the SharedObjectEditor should be notified of a local change instead of a remote one.
  Description of the changes:
  	Changed line 161 from 
  		objectEditor.operationApplied(op, false);
  	to 
  		objectEditor.operationApplied(op, true);
